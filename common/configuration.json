1. components
easy to change:
	# of feature points, cell of feature points	
	# of LK iteration
		set of different steps
		terminal condition	
	frequency of re-detection
		the threshold
		the interval between consecutive re-detections
		the detector
	coarse search
		the threshold
		the power (the area, the step and # of matching points)
hard to change:	
	parameter of SURF
		4bin or 8bin
	feature type
	motion model type
	optimization algorithm type
